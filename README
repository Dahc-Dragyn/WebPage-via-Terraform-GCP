# Cost-Effective Portfolio Website on GCP with Terraform

This Terraform configuration deploys a cost-effective and secure portfolio website on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It utilizes App Engine, Cloud Storage, IAM, and VPC networking to achieve a highly available and scalable solution.

## Architecture

* **Compute:** Google App Engine (GAE) Standard Environment for serverless application hosting.
* **Storage:** Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for storing website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images).
* **Networking:**  GAE's built-in load balancing and global CDN for high availability and low latency.
* **Security:** IAM for access control and a VPC with firewall rules for network isolation.

## Cost Optimization
